# 🎓 StudentPerformancePrediction-ML

This project is a simple **Machine Learning** model built to predict factors that affect student academic performance.  
It helps identify which features (like attendance, study hours, and participation) have the most significant impact on student grades.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing students from various nationalities, grade levels, and influencing factors such as:
- Number of hands raised in class  
- Attendance count  
- Study hours per week  
- Parental support and motivation  
- Course completion rate  

The main objective is to predict and analyze which factors most strongly influence the final marks of students.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – for data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for data visualization  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Several classifiers were trained and tested to identify the best-performing model:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

Each model was evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and visual plots.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes visual aids such as:
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Bar charts for feature importance  
- Confusion matrices for model evaluation  

These help interpret which parameters affect performance the most.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Input: CSV file containing student demographic and performance data.  
- Target Variable: **Student Grade/Performance**  
- Size: Moderate (few hundred records).  
- Example columns:
  ```
  Gender | Nationality | Class | HandRaisings | Attendance | StudyHours | Grade
  ```

---

## 🚀 Output

- Displays prediction of grades based on key influencing factors.  
- Compares accuracy across models.  
- Helps educators understand major success indicators.

---

## 🧩 Future Scope

- Add Deep Learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).  
- Integrate dashboard for real-time prediction.  
- Expand dataset with socio-economic parameters.
